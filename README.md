## 🧠 What’s Inside the Box?
Think of this app like a LEGO set—three pieces snap together:
- **HTML (`index.html`)**: The blueprint. It builds the buttons, input, and list.

## ✂️ Make It Your Own!
New to coding? Try these easy tweaks:
- **Change Colors**: Open `style.css`, find `rgb(22, 149, 218)` (blue), and swap it for `purple` or `#ff69b4` (hot pink).
- **Switch Fonts**: In `body`, replace the font with `"Comic Sans MS"` for a goofy vibe.
- **Move the Arrow**: In `.save-todo::before`, change `left: 0.75rem` to `2rem` for a bigger slide.
- **Green Alerts**: In `.notification-bar`, set `background-color: #00cc00` for a happy green popup.

> **Tip**: Open `style.css` in a text editor, save your changes, and refresh the browser to see the magic happen!

## 📱 Works on ALL Your Gadgets
- **Big Screen**: Wide and roomy, buttons side-by-side.
- **Tablet**: Neatly stacked, still snappy.
- **Phone**: Full-width buttons, easy to tap.

**Try It**: Press F12 in your browser, click the phone icon, and resize the window. Cool, right?
